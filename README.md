# Quantum Machine Learning Hypercausal System (QML-HCS)

**QML-HCS** is a research-grade framework for constructing, simulating, and analyzing quantum-inspired machine learning architectures with hypercausal feedback mechanisms.  
It integrates deterministic computation with causal inference and quantum-like superposition principles to explore emerging paradigms in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Causal Systems Theory.

---

## Overview

QML-HCS provides a modular and extensible environment for the study of hypercausal quantum modelsâ€”systems that unify classical causal inference with quantum-inspired dynamics such as superposition, reversible transformations, and probabilistic branching.  
It supports research into information propagation, causal stability, and consistency across interconnected quantum-like networks.

The framework is intended for scientific and engineering research in the following domains:

- **Quantum Machine Learning:** Development of quantum-inspired learning architectures.  
- **Causal Dynamics and Feedback Modeling:** Formalization of recursive multi-branch causal systems.  
- **Hybrid Quantumâ€“Classical Computation:** Simulation of efficient causal propagation in hybrid systems.  
- **Counterfactual Simulation:** Modeling systems capable of evaluating alternative causal scenarios.  
- **Algorithmic Benchmarking:** Studying quantum-efficient learning and reasoning processes on classical hardware.

---

## Core Objectives

1. **Hypercausal Feedback Modeling:** Implement layered feedback systems capable of multi-directional causal propagation.  
2. **Quantum-Inspired Efficiency:** Apply principles of superposition and entanglement to reduce computational cost.  
3. **Deterministicâ€“Stochastic Integration:** Provide configurable backends for deterministic, probabilistic, and mixed causal engines.  
4. **Scientific Transparency:** Ensure reproducibility and open experimentation through standardized interfaces.  
5. **Scalability and Extensibility:** Support modular expansion for backends, loss functions, and causal evaluators.

## Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install qml-hcs
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
pip install qml-hcs==0.1.0
```

Verify installation:

```bash
python -c "import qmlhc; print(qmlhc.__version__)"
```

This mode is recommended for research and production environments where the source code remains static but full access to all APIs and modules is required.

---

## Getting Started

To verify installation, execute the minimal example:

```bash
qmlhc-demo
```

or run directly as a module:

```bash
python -m qmlhc.examples.ex_minimal_core_demo
```

Expected output (abridged):

```
=== Minimal Core Demo ===
output_dim (D):     3
branches (K):       3
...
HCModel.forward() matches single-node result âœ”
```

Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.rst) for further instructions.

## Examples

The repository provides several scientifically oriented demonstrations:

- Minimal hypercausal core operation  
- Depth-dependent evaluation of feedback models  
- Quantum-inspired benchmarking and stability testing  
- Training with callback telemetry and adaptive losses  
- Coherence and consistency experiments under stochastic variation  

All examples are documented in the [Examples Section](docs/examples.rst).

## Intended Research Applications

QML-HCS serves as a research platform for the theoretical and experimental study of quantum-inspired machine learning.  
It facilitates investigations in:

- Quantum-efficient learning architectures  
- Simulation of adaptive feedback systems  
- Analysis of causal consistency and information stability  
- Hybrid quantumâ€“classical training methodologies  
- Exploration of hypercausal structures for predictive and inferential modeling  

By providing a deterministic yet quantum-compatible environment, QML-HCS enables the testing of emerging theories in quantum-causal computation without the need for specialized quantum hardware.
